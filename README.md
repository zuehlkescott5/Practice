# Scott's Practice Page

## My unofficial git Repo for all things Scott and coding.  This will eventually include:

* R practice
* Python practice
* Java practice
* Javascript practice


## Motivation:

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist and Analyst.  While I don't classify myself as an engineer, I do believe that engineering holds its place as a tool to accomplish analytic projects.

I have written Statistical algorithms in SAS and R.  I have used Java to deliver results of various reports and monitors that I've built.  

## Check out my Coursera Repo!

I have completed seven of the 10 courses in the Data Science Specialization, nearly complete with my eighth.  This will be up to date as the remaining courses are complete.
